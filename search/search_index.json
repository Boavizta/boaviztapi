The full list of configuration parameters and their defaults can be found in boaviztapi/utils/config.py . Overriding default values Each variable can be overridden using an environment variable of the same name, prefixed with BOAVIZTA_ . For example, the default_server parameter can be overridden with the environment variable, BOAVIZTA_DEFAULT_SERVER . CORS By default, all origins are allowed, but can be changed with the BOAVIZTA_ALLOWED_ORIGINS environment variable with the following format: BOAVIZTA_ALLOWED_ORIGINS = '[\"url1\", \"url2\", ...]' For example: BOAVIZTA_ALLOWED_ORIGINS='[\"https://datavizta.boavizta.org\",\"https://boavizta.org\"]' . Special message You can customize the home page with a special message by setting the environment variable BOAVIZTA_SPECIAL_MESSAGE in HTML format. For example: BOAVIZTA_SPECIAL_MESSAGE=\"<p>my welcome message in HTML format</p>\" Default location The default location will be used if the user does not specify a usage_location in the request. The parameter is used to complete the impact of electricity. default_location: \"EEE\" This can be overridden with the BOAVIZTA_DEFAULT_LOCATION environment variable. Default archetype The default archetype will be used if the user does not specify an archetype in the request. Note that it must match an existing archetype ID in the archetype files. default_cpu: \"DEFAULT\" default_server: \"compute_medium\" These can be overridden with the BOAVIZTA_DEFAULT_CPU and BOAVIZTA_DEFAULT_SERVER environment variables. Default criteria The default criteria will be used if the user does not specify the criteria in the request. default_criteria: [\"gwp\", \"adp\", \"pe\"] This can be overridden with the BOAVIZTA_DEFAULT_CRITERIA environment variable. Minimal significant figures The minimal number of significant figures will be employed if classical rounding yields a result containing more significant figures than the minimal allowed. min_sig_fig: 1 If set to 1, the results will be rounded at least to 1 significant figures. This can be overridden with the BOAVIZTA_MIN_SIG_FIG environment variable. Maximal significant figures The maximum number of significant figures will be employed if classical rounding yields a result containing more significant figures than the maximum allowed. max_sig_fig: 5 If set to 5, the results will be rounded to a maximum of 5 significant figures. This can be overridden with the BOAVIZTA_MAX_SIG_FIG environment variable. Uncertainty percentage Uncertainty percentage is used to adapt the intensity of the rounding. The lower the uncertainty percentage, the lower aggressive the rounding. uncertainty: 10 If set to 10, the rounding aggressiveness will be set to 10%. This can be overridden with the BOAVIZTA_UNCERTAINTY environment variable. CPU name fuzzymatch threshold The CPU name fuzzymatch threshold will determine the minimum similarity between the CPU name in the request and the CPU name in the database.

While the digital product carbon footprint repository aggregates non-transparent manufacturer data, the API reports impacts via an open, auditable and improvable bottom-up approach. Our impacts factors relies mostly on peered reviewed publications taken from scientific or industrial literature. How the API data differs to other datasets (like Negaoctet or Ecoinvent for example)? The API is not intended to offer the same level of quality as private databases. However, it allows anyone to evaluate the impacts of digital assets in a free, automated, open, auditable and community-improvable way. Methodology How does the API compute environmental impacts related to raw material acquisition, manufacture, transport and end of life? Those impacts are retrieved with a bottom-up approach when possible. The impacts are evaluated according to the technical configuration of the components sent by the user or completed by the API. Note that end of life is not taken into account in this approach for now. We would like to take them into account. However, we lack open impact factors to do so. If you have ideas to fill this gap, please let us know. When a bottom-up approach is not possible we rely on non-specific impact factors per type of equipment. See: Embedded methodology How does the API compute environmental impacts related to usage? Usage impacts are retrieved by multiplying a power over a duration with an impact factor relative to the place of use of the evaluated asset. See: Usage methodology How does the API handle electrical consumption? Electrical consumption can either be given by the user or modeled according to the context of use and the technical configuration of the asset. See: Electricity methodology How do we compute the impacts of cloud instances? The technical configuration of cloud instances are pre-recorded in the API. Their impacts are computed through the bottom-up process. The electricity is modeled from the technical configuration and the context of usage given by the user. See: Cloud methodology How does the API amortize embedded impacts? The API implements two methods to amortize embedded impacts. Either the total embedded impact is given or a linear amortization over the life cycle of the assets can be applied. See: Allocation methodology How do we handle missing data? The API returns impacts regardless of the level of detail given by the user. To do this, two strategies are possible: Default data can be used depending on the \"archetype\" selected by the user. See: Archetype Data can be completed according to other values sent by the user. See: Auto complete Technical How can I use the API?

Simply define the resources they reserve and identify the server archetype on which the instance will be hosted. Refer to the contribution documentation for more information. Internal changes Externalizing impacts computation outside the asset's model by creating a service for this purpose (boaviztapi/service/impacts_computation.py) Updating cloud instance model and impacts computation in line with : https://github.com/Boavizta/boaviztapi/issues/252#issuecomment-1845967609 Improve impact model (boaviztapi/model/impact.py). All the assets keep the impacts as an attribute once they have been calculated. Performance is significantly improved in the event of a verbose call. Bug fixes Power consumption was modelled for one component unit. Consumption was only multiplied by the number of components when calculating impacts at device level. The consumption of the component now reflects the consumption of all the units. https://github.com/Boavizta/boaviztapi/issues/256 https://github.com/Boavizta/boaviztapi/issues/257 https://github.com/Boavizta/boaviztapi/pull/243 https://github.com/Boavizta/boaviztapi/pull/248 Breaking changes 'instance_per_instance' is no longer included in the verbose output of the cloud route. Previously, the verbose returned the impacts of each platform's components in their entirety. Now, only the impacts associated with the instance are returned for each component. Components impacts returned by cloud router shouldn't be divided by instance_per_instance .

Duration & allocation Before Duration was a field in the usage object called hours_use_time . { \"usage\": { \"hours_use_time\": 2, } } Allocation was a route parameter. Now Duration is now a route parameter. Allocation is no longer used If not provided, we use the lifetime of the device as duration. We compute usage impacts over the duration and allocate embedded impacts on the duration over the lifetime of the device. We introduce the notion of use_time_ratio which is the proportion of time the device is used during the given duration. When a device is always used, the usage ratio is 1. When a device is never used, the usage ratio is 0. { \"usage\": { \"use_time_ratio\": 0.5, } } Impacts format Before \"gwp\" : { \"manufacture\" : 1900 , \"use\" : 260 , \"unit\" : \"kgCO2eq\" }, or \"manufacture_impacts\" : { \"gwp\" : { \"value\" : 23.8 , \"unit\" : \"kgCO2eq\" }, \"pe\" : { \"value\" : 353 , \"unit\" : \"MJ\" }, \"adp\" : { \"value\" : 0.02 , \"unit\" : \"kgSbeq\" } } } Now Impact formats are now unified. \"manufacture\" is now called \"embedded\" \"impacts\" : { \"gwp\" : { \"embedded\" : { \"value\" : 6.68 , \"min\" : 6.68 , \"max\" : 6.68 , \"warnings\" : [ \"End of life is not included in the calculation\" ] }, \"use\" : \"not implemented\" , \"unit\" : \"kgCO2eq\" , \"description\" : \"Total climate change\" }, Verbose format Before \"USAGE\" : { ... \"usage_impacts\" : { ... } \"avg_power\" : { \"value\" : 94.62364134445255 , \"unit\" : \"W\" , \"status\" : \"COMPLETED\" , \"source\" : null }, ... } Now For each component, all attributes are now at the same level in the dictionary.

Error margin from incomplete user input Error can also be caused by incomplete user input. This type of error margins are taken into account. Error margin from default values Error margins are set when DEFAULT values are used. For example, if you do not provide the usage location of a device, the API will use the default usage location of the device.In this case we set a minimal (min) and maximal value (max) based on the available usage location and compute the impact with the minimal and maximal value to report a min and max impacts values. Error margin from archetype values Error margins are set when ARCHETYPE values are used. For example, if you do not provide any information on your CPU, we will use the value of the attribute taken from the archetype.

Rounding Impact values are rounded depending on the distance between min and max values. The bigger the difference, the more aggressive the rounding. To adapt the intensity of the rounding, we use an uncertainty percentage which can be set in configuration file. The default value is 10%.

assessed with the specific impacts of the French electrical grid. The server impacts are assessed for a usage of 1 year (since duration is set at 8785 hours). The average electrical consumption per hour is 250 Watts/hour. Embedded impacts will be allocated on 1 year (since duration is set at 8785 hours). Retrieve the impacts with a custom workload In this query, we use the default server configuration of a platform_compute_medium but provide a specific usage of the machine. In this case, the average electrical consumption is unknown. We use the level of workload ( time_workload ) of the machine as a proxy for the power consumption.
