# MANUFACTURE METHODOLOGY

Manufacture impacts are measured at components and device level. 
**The total impacts of manufacture is returned independently on the use duration.**

## Documentation

We use a bottom-up methodology to measure the manufacture impacts of devices by aggregating the impacts of each of their components. 


### Variable components impacts

The impact of variable components are proportional to the die size of their chips

* CPU
* RAM
* DISK (SSD)


### Fixed components impacts

The impact of fixed component are set by default

* DISK (HDD)
* MOTHERBOARD
* POWER SUPPLY
* MANUFACTURE ASSEMBLY

### Particular components impacts

* [USAGE](usage.md)
