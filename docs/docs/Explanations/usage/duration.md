# Duration

Usage impacts are assessed for a specific time duration given by the user as a query parameter.

When no duration is given, the impacts are measured for the all lifespans of the device.


## Usage ratio

The usage ratio is the proportion of time the device is used during the given duration. When a device is always used, the usage ratio is 1. When a device is never used, the usage ratio is 0.

Users can give the usage ratio in the usage object.
