# Usage methodology

Usage impacts can be measured at device or component level from usage configuration. 

Usage impacts are measured by multiplying a **[duration](duration.md)**, an **[impact factor](elec_factors.md)**, and an **[electrical consumption](elec_conso.md)** :

```impact = electrical_consumption * duration * impact_factor```
