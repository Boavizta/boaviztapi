### Methodology

IoT device impacts are the sum of the impacts of the [functional blocks](../components/functional_blocks.md) that compose them.

$$
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\text{iot_device}_\text{embedded}^\text{criteria} & = \sum_{\set{\text{functional_blocks}}}{\text{functional_block}_
\text{embedded}^\text{criteria}} \\ \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
$$

## Usage impact

Only [power consumption](../usage/elec_conso.md) is implemented.
