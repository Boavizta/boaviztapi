Here is the list of impact criteria implemented in the API.

## GWP - Global warming potential

__What__ : Global warming potential (GWP) is the heat absorbed by any greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, as a multiple of
the heat that would be absorbed by the same mass of carbon dioxide (CO2). GWP is 1 for CO2. For other gases it depends
on the gas and the time frame.

__Unit__ : kgCO2e

## PE - Primary energy

__What__ : Primary energy (PE) is an energy form found in nature that has not been subjected to any human engineered
conversion process. It is energy contained in raw fuels, and other forms of energy, including waste, received as input
to a system. Primary energy can be non-renewable or renewable.

__Unit__ : MJ

## ADP - Abiotic Depletion Potential

__What__ : ADP is the first EI category presented. This category corresponds to mineral and resources used and is, in
this sense, mainly influenced by the rate of resources extracted [245]. The effect of this consumption on their
depletion is estimated according to their availability stock at a global scale [246]. This impact category is divided
into two components: a material component and a fossil fuels component. [We use a version of ADP wich include both]
