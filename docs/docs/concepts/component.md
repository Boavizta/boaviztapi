# Component

A component is the smallest element of the api. It is an abstract object which 
can represent either a physical component (CPU, RAM, SSD, ...), or an actions (assembly, transport, usage, ...).
They each have one to several impacts and a specific use-phase. 
Only manufacture is implemented for now.

## Example

* CPU
* SSD
