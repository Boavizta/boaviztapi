# Welcome to BOAVIZTA TOOLS DOCUMENTATION

Boavizta is a working group with a mission to make the environmental impact measurement of IT / digital technologies in organizations more reliable, simpler and faster.

The group federates and connects stakeholders of the "IT / digital environmental impacts measurement" ecosystem (companies, associations, research - 100+ members) and facilitates peer-to-peer help.

It also organizes the co-construction of expert and updated resources under open / free licenses: 

* IT / digital environmental impacts measurement methodology
* IT / digital environmental footprint data repository
* IT / digital environmental impacts calculation engine

These "commons" cover digital infrastructures and services, and allow full life cycle / multi-criteria assessments.

This is the documentation of Boavizta IT / digital environmental impacts calculation engine.
