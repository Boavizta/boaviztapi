**Boavizta** is a working group with a mission to make the environmental impacts assessment of ICT/digital technologies in organizations more reliable, easier and faster.

The group federates and connects stakeholders of the "ICT/digital environmental impacts evaluation" ecosystem (companies, associations, researcher - 150+ members) and facilitates peer-to-peer help.

It also organizes the co-construction of expert and updated resources under open / free licenses:

* Methodologies for the assessment of ICT/digital environmental impacts. See https://boavizta.org/methodologie.
* Environmental data repositories. See https://boavizta.org/donnees.
* Tools to implement ICT/digital environmental impacts assessment (such as this API). See https://boavizta.org/tools.

These digital "commons" cover digital infrastructures, equipment and services, and allow full life cycle / multi-criteria assessments.
