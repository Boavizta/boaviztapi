## Work on the documentation

### Install the documentation tools

Documentation is generated from markdown using `mkdocs` with the `material` theme.

```bash
# (preferred) Install mkdocs and its extensions
poetry install --with docs

# (old way) install mkdocs and its extensions
pip install mkdocs mkdocs-render-swagger-plugin mkdocs-material mkdocs-macros-plugin
```

ðŸ’¡ Do not mixup _pip_ and _brew_ installation of `mkdocs` (see [troubleshooting](https://jimandreas.github.io/mkdocs-material/troubleshooting/)).

### Launch a local documentation server

```bash
# If mkdocs is installed via poetry (preferred)
# from the root of the cloned repository
cd docs
poetry run mkdocs serve
```

```bash
# If mkdocs is installed globally
# from the root of the cloned repository
cd docs
mkdocs serve
```

Open <http://localhost:8080>

### Verify the links

```bash
cd docs
# Check the warnings in the output for broken links 
poetry run mkdocs build
# Test validity of external links 
poetry run poetry run linkcheckMarkdown --recurse --verbose docs
```
