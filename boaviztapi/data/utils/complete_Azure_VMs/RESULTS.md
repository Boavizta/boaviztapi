# Azure Impacts results generated by BoaviztAPI

This is the documentation regarding the data in `results.csv`, generated by the BoaviztAPI, based on data aggregated in April 2024 for Microsoft Azure cloud instances.

In this document the word "phase" as in "lifecycle phase" regarding the lifecycle of a digital product or service, following the ISO 14040. Those phases are : raw material extraction, manufacturing, transport, use and end of life.

## Columns reference

`gwp_manufacturing_1h_impact`: **G**lobal **W**arming **P**otential footprint estimated by the API, with an allocation of the impact for 1h runtime, considering the ratio `duration` / `server_lifetime` (see the[API's documentation](https://doc.api.boavizta.org/Explanations/embedded_methodology/)), in **kgC02eq**

Embedded impacts returned per instance are a sub allocation of the bare metal server embedded impacts. The formulas used for this allocation are described [in the API documentation](https://doc.api.boavizta.org/Explanations/services/cloud/#method).

Use phase energy consumption and GWP footprint are calculated, depending on the CPU load percentage hypothesis and the usage location.

Energy consumption columns follow the naming convention `energy_1h_loadX`, **X** being the CPU time usage percentage hypothesis.

Global Warming Potential footprint on the use phase is reported in the columns following the naming pattern `gwp_use_1h_loadX_Y`, **X** being the CPU time usage percentage hypothesis, **Y** being the usage location in the form of a three-letter code, like **GBR** for Great Britain, **FRA** for France, **USA** for the United States etc.. You can find the available country codes [in the columns of this table](https://github.com/Boavizta/boaviztapi/blob/main/boaviztapi/data/crowdsourcing/electrical_mix.csv).

**Lifetime hypothesis** for bare metal hosts is of 52560 hours / 6 years. According to latest news, Azure extended servers lifetime from 4 to 6 years. (https://www.networkworld.com/article/971373/microsoft-extends-azure-server-lifetimes-by-50.html).

For example:

- `energy_1h_load0`:  reports the estimated energy consumption attributed to a given instance, running 1h, in IDLE state / CPU time usage being close to 0%
- `energy_1h_load50`: reports the estimated energy consumption attributed to a given instance, running 1h, in an active state with CPU time usage being about 50%
- `energy_1h_load100`: reports the estimated energy consumption attributed to a given instance, running 1h, in an active state with CPU time usage being about 100%
- `gwp_use_1h_load0_FRA`: reports the estimated greenhouse gas emissions attributed to a given instance, in an IDLE state / CPU time usage being close to 0%, in France
- `gwp_use_1h_load0_GBR`: reports the estimated greenhouse gas emissions attributed to a given instance, in an IDLE state / CPU time usage being close to 0%, in the United Kingdom

## Impact criterias and life cyccle phases covered

- Green House Gaz emissions / Global Warming Potential (see GHG protocol as a reference)
    - resources extraction (LCA) / scope 3 (GHG protocol) ✔️
    - use (LCA) / scope 2 (GHG protocol) ✔️
    - manufacturing (LCA) / scope 3 (GHG protocol) ✔️
    - shipping (LCA) / scope 3 (GHG protocol) ❌
    - end of life (LCA) / scope 3 (GHG protocol) ❌

At the moment we write those lines, [end-of-life impacts are not covered by BoaviztAPI](https://doc.api.boavizta.org/Explanations/embedded_methodology/), so this results file does not include them neither.
