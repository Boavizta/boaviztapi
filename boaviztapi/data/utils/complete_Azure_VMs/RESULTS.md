# Azure Impacts results generated by BoaviztAPI

This is the documentation regarding the data in `results.csv`, generated by the BoaviztAPI, based on data aggregated in April 2024 for Microsoft Azure cloud instances. 

In this document the word "phase" as in "lifecycle phase" regarding the lifecycle of a digital product or service, following the ISO 14040. Those phases are : raw material extraction, manufacturing, transport, use and end of life.

## Columns reference

`gwp_manufacturing_impact_total`: **G**lobal **W**arming **P**otential footprint estimated by the API for , in **kgC02eq**

Use phase energy consumption and GWP footprint are calculated, depending on the CPU load percentage hypothesis and the usage location.

Energy consumption columns follow the naming convention `energy_1h_loadX`, **X** being the CPU time usage percentage hypothesis.

Global Warming Potential footprint on the use phase is reported in the columns following the naming pattern `gwp_use_1h_loadX_Y`, **X** being the CPU time usage percentage hypothesis, **Y** being the usage location in the form of a three-letter code, like **GBR** for Great Britain, **FRA** for France, **USA** for the United States etc.. You can find the available country codes [in the columns of this table](https://github.com/Boavizta/boaviztapi/blob/main/boaviztapi/data/crowdsourcing/electrical_mix.csv).

For example: 

- `energy_1h_load0`:  reports the estimated energy consumption attributed to a given instance, running 1h, in IDLE state / CPU time usage being close to 0%
- `energy_1h_load50`: reports the estimated energy consumption attributed to a given instance, running 1h, in an active state with CPU time usage being about 50%
- `energy_1h_load100`: reports the estimated energy consumption attributed to a given instance, running 1h, in an active state with CPU time usage being about 100%
- `gwp_use_1h_load0_FRA`: reports the estimated greenhouse gas emissions attributed to a given instance, in an IDLE state / CPU time usage being close to 0%, in France
- `gwp_use_1h_load0_GBR`: reports the estimated greenhouse gas emissions attributed to a given instance, in an IDLE state / CPU time usage being close to 0%, in the United Kingdom
